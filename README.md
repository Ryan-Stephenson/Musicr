musicr
=========

Function
---------

Musicr is a web-based music library I was working on awhile ago. It automatically scans the music folder and outputs the music library to the user.

File System
---------

The music files must be stored as 'music->artist->album->songs' with the the album image being stored in the same folder as the songs with the format .jpg or .png.

Wikipedia, Youtube and Last.fm Links
---------

This links are automatically generated to search the respective site and as such may not always link to the desired content.

Future Plans
---------

-Stored song data in database or json file so it doesn't need to be rescanned each time. (Already have code partly written)
-Song statistics

Important Notes
---------

I have not worked on musicr is a fairly long time and as such am unsure of any technical risks and functionality errors, as such if you choose to use musicr do so at your own risk.
